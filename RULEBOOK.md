## Introduction

Welcome to **Food Chain TCG**, a strategic two-player card game where nature's hierarchy determines victory! Command one of five animal kingdoms—Amphibians, Birds, Fish, Mammals, or Reptiles—and use the natural food chain to outmaneuver your opponent.

In Food Chain TCG, you'll play creatures, cast spells, and most importantly, **feed your predators** to make them stronger. The player who reduces their opponent from 10 HP to 0 wins the game!

---

## Game Overview

Food Chain TCG combines strategic deck building with tactical gameplay. Each turn, you'll:
- Draw and play cards from your hand
- Build your field with creatures
- Feed prey to predators to power them up
- Attack your opponent's creatures or directly attack their HP
- Use spells and traps to disrupt your opponent's strategy

The unique **consumption mechanic** is at the heart of the game: when you play a predator, you may sacrifice friendly prey creatures on your field to make that predator permanently stronger and activate its special ability.

---

## Components

To play Food Chain TCG, you need:

- **2 Players**
- **2 Decks** (20 cards each, from one of the five animal categories)
- **Life Trackers** (starting at 10 HP each)
- **Turn Counter** (optional, helps track turn number)
- **A way to generate random numbers** (dice, coin, or digital random number generator)

---

## Deck Construction

### Category Selection
Each deck must consist of cards from **exactly one** of these categories:
- 🐸 **Amphibians** (Frogs, Toads, Salamanders, Newts)
- 🐦 **Birds** (Eagles, Owls, Songbirds, Waterfowl)
- 🐟 **Fish** (Sharks, Rays, Tropical Fish, Deep Sea Creatures)
- 🦌 **Mammals** (Predators, Ungulates, Rodents, Marine Mammals)
- 🦎 **Reptiles** (Crocodiles, Snakes, Lizards, Turtles)

### Deck Size Requirements
Your deck must contain **exactly 20 cards** with these restrictions:
- ✅ **Only 1 copy** of each card (no duplicates)
- ✅ **More Prey than Predators** (Example: 11 Prey + 9 Predators is valid, but 10 Prey + 10 Predators is not)
- ✅ Cards can be any mix of Prey, Predators, Spells, Free Spells, and Traps

**Note:** Tokens created during gameplay don't count toward deck construction limits.

---

## Game Setup

Follow these steps to begin a game:

1. **Shuffle Decks:** Both players shuffle their 20-card decks thoroughly.

2. **Set Life Totals:** Both players start at **10 HP**.

3. **Determine First Player:**
   - Both players roll a die (or use another random method)
   - The player with the **higher roll** chooses whether to go first or second
   - In case of a tie, re-roll

4. **Draw Opening Hands:** Both players draw **5 cards** from their deck.

5. **Begin First Turn:** The first player starts their turn (they do **not** draw a card on their very first turn).

---

## How to Win

**Reduce your opponent's HP from 10 to 0.**

You can damage your opponent by:
- Attacking them directly with creatures
- Using spell and ability effects that deal damage
- Some abilities that reduce HP directly

If both players reach 0 HP simultaneously, the game is a **draw**.

---

## Card Types

### Creature Cards

#### **Prey**
- Basic creatures with **ATK/HP** (Attack/Hit Points)
- Have a **Nutrition** value used when consumed by predators
- Can attack and defend like any creature
- Form the foundation of your food chain

**Example:** Golden Poison Frog: 1/1 (1) - Nutrition 1

#### **Predator**
- Powerful creatures with **ATK/HP**
- When played, may **consume** 1-3 friendly prey to gain stats and activate abilities
- Gain **+1 ATK and +1 HP** for each point of nutrition consumed
- Have special abilities that trigger when they consume

**Example:** Tiger Shark: 4/4 - Consumes prey to copy abilities from carrion

### Non-Creature Cards

#### **Spell**
- One-time effects that resolve immediately
- Counts toward your **one-card-per-turn limit**
- Goes to the **Exile** pile after use
- Can only be played during your **Main Phases**

#### **Free Spell**
- One-time effects like regular spells
- **Does NOT count** toward your one-card-per-turn limit
- Goes to the **Exile** pile after use
- Perfect for combos!

#### **Trap**
- Cards that can be played during your enemy's turn from the trap-holding player's hand
- Trigger for trap-holding player to decide automatically triggers during your **opponent's turn** when conditions are met
- Resolve **before** the triggering action completes
- Goes to **Exile** after triggering

---

## Game Zones

### **Hand**
- Cards you've drawn but haven't played yet
- Hidden from your opponent
- **No maximum hand size**

### **Deck**
- Your face-down draw pile
- When empty, you simply stop drawing (the game continues)

### **Field**
- The active play area where creatures exist
- **Maximum 3 creatures**
- Creatures on the field can attack, defend, and be consumed

### **Carrion Pile**
- Where destroyed creatures go (both prey and predators)
- Face-up and visible to both players
- Some effects interact with the carrion pile (like Scavenge)

### **Exile Pile**
- Where used spells, free spells, and traps go
- Face-up and visible to both players
- Generally doesn't interact with other game effects

---

## Turn Structure

Each turn follows this sequence:

### **1. Start Phase**
- Resolve all "start of turn" effects
- Frozen creatures die if their death timer has expired
- No standard actions available

### **2. Draw Phase**
- Draw **1 card** from your deck
- **Skip this phase if:**
  - You're the first player on your very first turn, OR
  - Your deck is empty

### **3. Main Phase 1**
- You may play **1 card** (Prey, Predator, Spell, or Trap)
- You may play **unlimited Free Spells** (these don't count toward the limit)
- Predators may consume when played

### **4. Before Combat Phase**
- Creatures with "before combat" abilities activate now
- You choose targets for each ability, resolving them one at a time
- Examples: Electric Eel deals 2 damage, Rainbow Mantis Shrimp deals 3 damage

### **5. Combat Phase**
- Declare which creatures you want to attack with
- Choose a target for each attacker (enemy creature or opponent directly)
- Resolve each attack
- See [Combat Rules](#combat-rules) for details

### **6. Main Phase 2**
- **Only if you didn't play a card in Main Phase 1**, you may play 1 card now
- Free Spells are still unlimited

### **7. End Phase**
- Resolve all "end of turn" effects
- Remove summoning exhaustion from your creatures (they can now attack the opponent directly)
- Clear frozen status from creatures (frozen creatures die)
- Pass the turn to your opponent

---

## Playing Cards

### **The One-Card-Per-Turn Rule**
You may play **only 1 card** per turn across both Main Phases combined, with these exceptions:
- ✅ **Free Spells** don't count toward this limit
- ✅ **Traps** are set during your turn but activate during opponent's turn

### **How to Play Cards**

#### **Playing Prey**
1. Select a prey card from your hand
2. Place it on your field (if you have fewer than 3 cards on the field)
3. The prey's "on play" effect activates immediately
4. The prey enters with summoning exhaustion (can't attack opponent directly until next turn)

#### **Playing Predators**
1. Select a predator card from your hand
2. **Choose 0-3 friendly prey/edible creatures to consume:**
   - You may consume prey on your field
   - If the predator has **Scavenge**, you may also consume from your carrion pile
   - Total consumed cannot exceed 3
3. **Calculate stat gain:** +1 ATK and +1 HP per nutrition point consumed
4. **If at least 1 creature was consumed**, the predator's ability activates
5. Consumed creatures move to carrion
6. The predator enters the field with its new stats

**Dry Dropping:** Playing a predator without consuming anything is called a "dry drop." The predator enters with base stats and its ability does NOT activate. This is marked visually on the card.

#### **Playing Spells**
1. Select and play the spell from your hand
2. Choose targets if required
3. The effect resolves immediately
4. The spell goes to the Exile pile

#### **Playing Traps**
1. Play the trap from your hand during your Main Phase
2. The trap remains hidden from your opponent
3. When the trigger condition occurs during opponent's turn, the trap activates automatically
4. The trap resolves, then goes to Exile

---

## Combat Rules

### **Who Can Attack?**
- Any creature on your field can attack **enemy creatures** immediately (even on the turn they're played)
- A creature can attack the **opponent directly** only if:
  - It has **Haste**, OR
  - It has been on your field since the start of your turn (survived one full turn cycle)

### **Declaring Attacks**
1. During your Combat Phase, select which creatures will attack
2. For each attacker, choose a valid target:
   - An enemy creature, OR
   - The opponent directly (if allowed)

### **Target Restrictions**
- **Hidden** creatures cannot be targeted by attacks (but can be attacked with AoE or if attacker has Acuity)
- **Invisible** creatures cannot be targeted by attacks or spells (but can be hit by AoE)
- **Lure** creatures MUST be attacked if able (if multiple Lure creatures exist, attacker chooses among them)
- **Acuity** allows a creature to target Hidden and Invisible creatures

### **Resolving Combat**

#### **Creature vs. Creature**
1. Both creatures deal damage to each other **simultaneously**
2. Damage equals each creature's **ATK** value
3. Damage is subtracted from **HP**
4. **Barrier** prevents the first instance of damage
5. **Ambush** prevents the attacker from taking damage if it kills the defender
6. Any creature reduced to 0 or less HP is destroyed and moved to carrion

#### **Direct Attack**
1. The attacking creature deals damage equal to its **ATK** to the opponent
2. The opponent loses that much **HP**
3. No damage is dealt back to the attacker

### **Special Combat Interactions**

**Neurotoxic:** When a creature with Neurotoxic deals combat damage, the damaged creature becomes **Paralyzed** (loses all abilities, gains Harmless, and dies at the end of its controller's next turn).

**Passive:** Creatures with Passive cannot attack but can still be attacked.

**Immune:** Immune creatures only take damage from direct creature attacks (they ignore spell damage and ability damage).

---

## The Consumption System

The consumption mechanic is unique to Food Chain TCG and separates it from other card games.

### **When Can You Consume?**
- **Only when playing a predator**
- Consumption occurs as part of playing the predator, before it enters the field

### **What Can Be Consumed?**
- **Friendly prey** currently on your field
- **Friendly predators with Edible** currently on your field
- **Creatures in your carrion pile** (only if the predator has **Scavenge**)

### **How Many Can You Consume?**
- Minimum: **0** (this is a "dry drop")
- Maximum: **3** total (combined from field and carrion)

### **What Happens When You Consume?**

1. **Choose targets:** Select up to 3 valid targets to consume
2. **Calculate nutrition:** Add up the nutrition values:
   - Prey creatures have a printed **Nutrition** value
   - Edible predators use their current **ATK** as nutrition
3. **Gain stats:** The predator gains **+1 ATK and +1 HP** per nutrition point
4. **Activate ability:** If at least 1 creature was consumed, the predator's ability triggers
5. **Move consumed creatures:** All consumed creatures move to your carrion pile
6. **Enter field:** The predator enters the field with its new stats

### **Dry Dropping**
If you play a predator without consuming anything:
- It enters with **base stats** (the ATK/HP printed on the card)
- Its ability **does NOT activate**
- It's marked with a 🍂 symbol
- **Dry-dropped predators lose all keyword abilities**

### **Example**
You play **Tiger Shark (4/4)** and choose to consume:
- Golden Angelfish (Nutrition 1)
- Rainbow Sardine (Nutrition 1)
- Hardhead Catfish (Nutrition 1)

**Result:** Tiger Shark enters as a **7/7** (4+3 ATK, 4+3 HP) and its ability activates (copy abilities of a carrion predator).

---

## Keywords & Abilities

### **Combat Keywords**

#### **Haste**
Can attack the opponent directly on the turn it's played (ignores summoning exhaustion).

#### **Ambush**
If this creature kills its target when attacking, it takes no damage from combat. Otherwise, it takes damage normally.

#### **Passive**
Cannot attack. Can still defend, be consumed, and use other abilities.

### **Protection Keywords**

#### **Barrier**
Prevents the first instance of damage this creature would receive. The barrier is consumed and doesn't regenerate.

#### **Immune**
Only takes damage from direct creature attacks. Immune to spell damage, ability damage, and all other sources.

#### **Hidden**
Cannot be targeted by attacks (but can be targeted by spells). Area-of-effect damage still affects Hidden creatures.

#### **Invisible**
Cannot be targeted by attacks or spells. Area-of-effect and untargeted effects still work.

### **Targeting Keywords**

#### **Lure**
Enemy creatures must attack this creature if able. If multiple Lure creatures exist, the attacker chooses among them.

#### **Acuity**
Can target Hidden and Invisible creatures with attacks and targeted abilities.

### **Consumption Keywords**

#### **Edible**
This predator can be consumed by another predator as if it were prey. Its nutrition equals its current ATK.

#### **Scavenge**
When played, this predator may consume creatures from the carrion pile in addition to (or instead of) creatures on the field. Total consumed still limited to 3.

### **Effect Keywords**

#### **Free Play**
Playing this card doesn't count toward the one-card-per-turn limit.

#### **Neurotoxic**
When this creature deals combat damage, the damaged creature becomes Paralyzed (loses all abilities, gains Harmless, and dies at the end of its controller's next turn).

#### **Poisonous**
Deals 1 damage to the opponent at the end of their turn. (Note: Some cards may deal damage immediately when played or when they enter combat.)

#### **Toxic**
A stronger version of poisonous—typically kills any creature it damages in combat regardless of HP.

---

## Status Effects

### **Frozen ❄️**
- Cannot attack
- Cannot be consumed
- Thaws (removed) at end of controller's turn - creature survives
- Applied by freeze effects (NOT Neurotoxic - see Paralysis)

### **Summoning Exhaustion 💤**
- Cannot attack the opponent directly
- Can still attack enemy creatures
- Removed at the end of your turn (End Phase)
- Ignored by creatures with Haste

---

## Traps

Traps are reactive cards that punish your opponent's actions.

### **How Traps Work**

1. **Set the Trap:** During your Main Phase, play a trap from your hand. It counts toward your one-card-per-turn limit. The trap remains hidden from your opponent.

2. **Wait for Trigger:** The trap stays hidden until its trigger condition occurs during your opponent's turn.

3. **Automatic Activation:** When the trigger occurs, the trap activates automatically and resolves **before** the triggering action completes.

4. **Resolution:** The trap effect resolves, then the trap goes to the Exile pile.

### **Common Trap Triggers**

- **"When rival plays a pred"** — Triggers when opponent plays a predator
- **"When rival plays a prey"** — Triggers when opponent plays a prey
- **"When attacked directly"** — Triggers when your opponent attacks your HP
- **"When target enemy attacks directly"** — Triggers when a specific enemy creature attacks your HP
- **"When target creature is defending"** — Triggers when your creature is attacked
- **"When damaged indirectly"** — Triggers when you take non-combat damage

### **Timing**
Traps resolve **before** the triggering action completes. For example:
- A trap that negates a direct attack prevents the damage entirely
- A trap that triggers "when rival plays a pred" resolves before that predator's effect activates

---

## Special Rules

### **Slain Effects**
- A "slain" effect triggers **only** when a creature dies in combat against another creature
- Slain effects do **NOT** trigger if:
  - The creature is consumed by a friendly predator
  - The creature is killed by a spell or ability
  - The creature is destroyed by other non-combat means

### **Play vs. Summon**
- When an effect says **"play"** a creature, it creates a token on the field
- The token's "on play" effect does **NOT** trigger
- Tokens function as normal creatures in all other ways

### **Token Creatures**
- Marked with ⚪ symbol and dashed border
- Function exactly like regular creatures
- Go to carrion when destroyed
- Can be consumed by predators
- Are **not** included in deck construction

### **Kill vs. Damage**
- **"Kill"** effects destroy the target instantly, regardless of HP
- **"Deal damage"** effects reduce HP and only destroy if HP reaches 0

### **Draw Effects**
- If an effect says "draw" without a number, draw **1 card**
- If your deck is empty, you cannot draw (the effect does nothing)

### **Discard Activations**
- Some cards have alternate effects that can be activated by discarding them from your hand
- Format: **"Discard: [effect]"**
- Can only be used during the appropriate trigger window
- Does **not** count toward the one-card-per-turn limit

### **Revealed Hand**
- When an effect reveals your opponent's hand, you can see all their cards for a few seconds
- The opponent cannot change or play cards while their hand is revealed
